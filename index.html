							<h2 class="post-header">Terms of Service</h2>
							<div class="post-content">
								This server hosts the Survival game mode as provided by Mojang Studios. Survival is an open-ended sandbox experience where player interaction is largely unrestricted. Gameplay elements such as PvP, destruction, and player conflict are part of the intended design of the game and may occur freely. As a result, the game environment may be chaotic, harsh, or unpleasant, which is generally the point.<br><br>
								That said, despite the game being about punching trees and each other, certain expectations exist outside of core gameplay.
							</div>
						</article>

						<article>
							<h3 class="post-header">Compliance & Stability</h3>
							<div class="post-content">
								All players are expected to follow the <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/usage-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minecraft Usage Guidelines</a>, <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/community-standards" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minecraft Community Standards</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/legal/community-standards" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Community Standards</a> that were agreed to when creating a Minecraft account, as required by Mojang Studios, who are very serious about these things.<br><br>
								Players may be expected to avoid actions that intentionally and significantly interfere with the operation or stability of the server. This may include, but is not limited to, abusing bugs, exploits, or unintended mechanics in a way that causes server disruption, lag, or other technical issues that affect the broader player base.
							</div>
						</article>

						<article>
							<h3 class="post-header">Chat and Community Notes</h3>
							<div class="post-content">
								In-game chat exists primarily to support gameplay. Excessive messaging, repeated spam, unsolicited advertising, or automated messages may be limited or restricted at any time, especially if they attract unwanted attention.<br><br>
								Behavior that may be interpreted as personal harassment, real-life threats, or targeted abuse beyond the scope of normal gameplay may be discouraged. Players are reminded that this is, in fact, a video game.<br><br>
								Content that may be reasonably interpreted as promoting harmful or hateful ideologies may be subject to review, because apparently even an anarchy server still has to say that.
							</div>
						</article>

						<article>
							<h3 class="post-header">Administrative Discretion</h3>
							<div class="post-content">
								Administrative action may be taken at any time, including but not limited to limiting chat access or server access, either temporarily or permanently. Such actions may depend on severity, impact, interpretation, alignment of the stars, or compliance obligations.<br><br>
